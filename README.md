## About

Casebase is an open-source app for consulting case interview preparation. The app is free and is available for download in the Apple store.

## Structure

Casebase provides practice cases that are structured as a series of pages with written information and graphics. Most pages include a question along with a corresponding input for the user's solution. Questions fall into one of three categories:

  1. Free response
    Any provided answer is marked as correct, as the quality of responses is impossible to evaluate.
  2. Numeric input
    An answer is marked as correct if it falls in the accepted range around the exact solution.
  3. Picker
    An answer is marked as correct if the correct option is selected.

## Tech Stack

Casebase is built with React Native and uses Redux for non-asynchronous data management.
