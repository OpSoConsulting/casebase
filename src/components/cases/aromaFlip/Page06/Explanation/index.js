        RMS is highest in air fresheners segment

        Occasionally, case study interviewers will seek to introduce novel terms in an interview to see how quickly you can grasp the new concepts.

        You may have already been familiar with the idea of RMS, but if not, all the information you needed was presented in the question. Computing Arabel’s market share as a ratio to the leading competitor’s gives an RMS of around 0.8 for the air fresheners segment and 0.5 for the men’s and women’s hygiene segments.

      <BodyText>
        The answer is somewhat counterintuitive as Arabel has the highest RMS in the segment where its absolute market share is the lowest. Otherwise, this question is rather straightforward.
