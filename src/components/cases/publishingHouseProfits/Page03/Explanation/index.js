        This problem requires us to eyeball the graph. Fortunately, the answer is fairly clear.
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        Proofreading services is the only group to see substantial profit declines over the past four years, but the disproportionate declines in revenue means the groupâ€™s profit margins rose. Eyeball estimates suggest the margins went from 6-7% to around 10%.
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        Content production profits fell even as revenues remained roughly stable. That translates into mediocre profit margin performance.
      </BodyText>
      <BodyText>
        Full services showed some small gains in profit, but that came with small gains in revenue. The trend in profit margins was probably slightly positive.
