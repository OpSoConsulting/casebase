        After further consideration, the team decides that any budget scoring of the proposal should also take into account the programâ€™s effect on national income and, transitively, on tax revenues. In total, the expansion is expected to add over 4.8 billion baht per year to Thai national income, with <Fraction>5/8</Fraction> of those income gains benefiting rural families. Generally poorer than their urban counterparts, this additional income will be taxed at an average rate of 5%.

        The other <Fraction>3/8</Fraction> of the income gains will go to urban families (who are taxed at a higher average rate), and generate an estimated 750 million baht in additional revenue over the five year period.
