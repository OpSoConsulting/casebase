        This isn’t a huge opportunity cost, but it’s enough to push Talumet’s forecasted annual profit from the agreement below $300,000, a threshold level in the eyes of trustees.

        In your discussions with Feedtech, you sensed they were more focused on pursuing the diffuse benefits of promotional rights to Talumet Farm. Feedtech wanted a historic farm and pasture to display on brochure materials, the opportunity for public outreach through tours of the new stable, and the general cachet that would come from a connection with a legacy farm like Talumet.

        Can you see a way to restructure the agreement to reduce the opportunity cost imposed on Talumet but maintain the benefits for Feedtech?
